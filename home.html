            <p>Zoro.com is an eCommerce company that sells business supplies, 
            equipment, and tools—but we’re much more than just a website. 
            We’re a team of great people who win and lose together (we prefer winning!). </p>
            
            <p> Since 2011, Zoro's incredible team has been working to help our customers get everything 
                they need to make their businesses go. We’ve grown super quickly in just a few years, 
                recently surpassing 400 team members and reaching annual revenue of over $500 million. 
                Add to that our award-winning culture—we were named 
                a Great Place to Work for 2019-20, among other accolades—and
                 we think Zoro is a pretty amazing launchpad for career growth and development.</p>

            <p>At Zoro, we pride ourselves on making sure our team members are taken 
                care of—while also building a culture where 
                our employees can bring their authentic selves to work and have a little bit of fun in the process.</p>

            <h1> Our Core Values</h1>
            <p>These are the values that keep us focused on what really matters. We developed them with input from team members
                 across the company—and we live them out every day, 
                 keeping them in mind as we tackle each new project, meeting, and initiative.</p>
